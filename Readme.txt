# UI Layout for Unwritten3D

This is currently just a visualization, the code is probably not transferable. As it is, it won't mesh with Unwritten3D's classes, etc.

It is also currently non-functional, in that items are not selectable and other interaction behavior is not yet implemented. Only the Inspector tab is currently visible.
